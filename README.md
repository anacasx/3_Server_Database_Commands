📘 Project Purpose

The main goal of this project is to automate the integration of information about university researchers and their academic publications by using the Google Scholar API.
This automation aims to streamline the process of retrieving, structuring, and storing relevant research data into a database, improving efficiency and reducing manual work.


⚙️ Key Functionalities

Performs GET requests to the Google Scholar Author API to obtain information about specific researchers.
Structures and displays the retrieved data following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern.
Stores the processed information (authors and articles) in a relational database.
Handles pagination, API errors, and connection exceptions to ensure reliable integration.
Uses version control through GitHub for collaborative development and documentation.


💡 Project Relevance

This project solves the problem of manual data collection and integration for research management systems.
By automating this process, it:
Saves time.
Enhances collaboration between researchers and database administrators.
Facilitates faster generation of scientific production reports.
Provides a scalable foundation for future integrations with other APIs.
